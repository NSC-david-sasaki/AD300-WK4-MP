    Interface Creation:
        Create an interface called MediaPlayer.
        Define methods in the MediaPlayer interface such as play(), pause(), and stop().

    Class Implementations:
        Implement the MediaPlayer interface in at least three different classes (e.g., AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer, and StreamingPlayer). Each class should provide specific implementations of the interface methods.

    Functionality:
        play() should display a message indicating what type of media is playing along with the media's title.
        pause() should display a message indicating that the player has paused.
        stop() should display a message indicating that the player has stopped.

    Testing:
        Create a main class to demonstrate using instances of each player type.
        Instantiate each type of media player and invoke their methods to ensure they behave as expected.

Instructions:

    Define the MediaPlayer interface with the required methods.
    Create three classes that implement MediaPlayer, providing specific behaviors for play(), pause(), and stop().
    In the main class, create instances of each player type and call their methods to simulate playing, pausing, and stopping different media.
    Comment your code adequately to describe the functionality.
